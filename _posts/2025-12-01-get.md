Public repositories often lack standardised descriptors that matter for cheese ecology. MetaCheeseDB provides cheese-specific metadata — not just sequencing descriptors. Indeed, for each sample we compiled **42 metadata fields**, including both technical descriptors, and food- and process-related variables. We additionally provide a harmonised subset of **18 standardised metadata fields** designed for robust cross-study comparisons.

Examples of curated cheese-relevant fields include:
- milk source and animal management (where available)
- thermal treatment (e.g., pasteurisation)
- starter strategy (including backslopping / natural whey culture)
- curd treatment and ripening context
- rind presence and sampled compartment (core vs rind)
- texture class (soft / semi-hard / hard / very hard)
- geographical origin and certification status (PDO/PGI where applicable)

You can find the full metadata table at [this link](https://magliulo.github.io/metacheesedb/jekyll/2025-12-03-metadata.html).
