MetaCheeseDB pairs each shotgun metagenome with **cheese-specific, production-aware metadata** to enable robust cross-study comparisons. Public sequencing repositories often include technical descriptors (platform, library layout, run accessions) but rarely provide the processing details that shape cheese microbial ecology. For this reason, we manually curated and harmonised a set of **analysis-ready metadata fields** focused on the cheese environment, with controlled vocabularies to reduce ambiguity and missingness.

These fields support filtering, stratified analyses, and model building (e.g., comparing communities across texture classes, starter strategies, milk treatments, or ripening regimes), while keeping categories interpretable and consistent across studies.

# Analysis-ready metadata fields (controlled vocabularies)

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| **Curd_cutting** | Approximate curd cutting size/handling | Ladled; Large; Small |
| **Presence_of_rind** | Whether the cheese has a rind | Facoltative; No; Yes |
| **Backslopping** | Use of backslopping (e.g., natural whey culture carry-over) | No; Yes |

# Notes on interpretation

- **“Facoltative”** indicates that the feature is allowed/optional within a production disciplinary or reported inconsistently across sources, rather than strictly present/absent.
- Several fields are correlated in real production systems (e.g., **technology**, **curd temperature**, **starter strategy**, and **ripening period**). For statistical testing and ML, consider multivariable models and leakage-aware validation.
- Metadata completeness varies across studies. When running comparative analyses, we recommend filtering to records with non-missing values for the fields of interest.

# Reuse

You are welcome to reuse the metadata tables for research and benchmarking. If you publish analyses using MetaCheeseDB metadata, please cite the MetaCheeseDB manuscript (when available) and the original primary studies for the underlying sequencing datasets (accessions are provided in the sample table).
