MetaCheeseDB pairs each shotgun metagenome with **cheese-specific and production-aware metadata** to enable robust cross-study comparisons. Public sequencing repositories often include technical descriptors (platform, library layout, run accessions) but rarely provide the processing details that shape cheese microbial ecology. For this reason, we manually curated and harmonised a set of **analysis-ready metadata fields** focused on the cheese environment, with controlled vocabularies to reduce ambiguity and missingness.

Following is a summary table of the 18 harmonised metadata fields:
<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Field | What it describes | Allowed values |

| **Skimming** | Fat removal | Facoltative; No; Partially; Yes |
| **Inoculation_of_moulds** | Use of mould inoculation during production | None; Yes |
| **Curd_cutting** | Approximate curd cutting size | Ladled; Large; Small |
| **Presence_of_rind** | Whether the cheese has a rind | Facoltative; No; Yes |
| **Backslopping** | Use of backslopping | No; Yes |
| **Starter_culture** | Type of starter strategy | NWC; Selected |
| **Technology_of_production** | Broad technological class | Cooked_curd; Pasta_filata; Semicooked; Uncooked; Uncooked_OR_Semicooked |

# Notes on interpretation

- **“Facoltative”** indicates that the feature is allowed/optional within a production disciplinary.
- Blank fields are to be considered as not available information.
- Metadata completeness varies across studies. When running comparative analyses, we recommend filtering to records with non-missing values for the fields of interest.

# Reuse

You are welcome to reuse the metadata tables for research and benchmarking. If you publish analyses using MetaCheeseDB metadata, please cite the MetaCheeseDB manuscript (when will be available) and the present GitHub repository.
