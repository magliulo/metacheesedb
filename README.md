### Metadata-curated Cheese Database

**MetaCheeseDB** is an open source metadata-curated catalogue of cheese metagenomes for studying the cheese microbiome across production technologies, geography, and cheese style. It integrates **1,593** shotgun metagenomes spanning **156 cheese subtypes** from **19 countries** across **4 continents**, combining publicly available datasets with newly sequenced **PDO/PGI** cheeses.

Our goal is simple: make cheese metagenomics *comparable*. MetaCheeseDB pairs high-resolution microbiome data with **cheese-specific, production-aware metadata** so that researchers can test ecological and functional hypotheses at scale, and stakeholders can explore microbiome signatures relevant to quality, authenticity, and innovation.
