![MetaCheeseDB](assets/gitbook/images/metacheesedb.png)

[**MetaCheeseDB**](https://magliulo.github.io/raffaelemagliulo/files/MetaCheeseDB.html) is an open source metadata-curated catalogue of cheese metagenomes for studying the cheese microbiome across production technologies and geography. It integrates **1,593** shotgun metagenomes spanning **156 cheese subtypes** from **19 countries** among **4 continents**, combining publicly available datasets with newly sequenced **Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI)** cheeses. MetaCheeseDB pairs high-resolution microbiome data with **cheese-specific metadata** so that researchers can test ecological and functional hypotheses at scale, and stakeholders can explore microbiome signatures relevant to quality, authenticity, and innovation.
